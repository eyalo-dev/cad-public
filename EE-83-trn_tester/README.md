This is functional similar but not exact copy.
All dimension were estimated by eye.
Tried to use similar component placment as much as posible, but using only Kicad
standard PCB component library, so dimentions may very.

Need to verify measurement of meter contacts for vertical mounting, like artical.

Two versions:
- 1 my failed attempt to make PCB width smaller - fit within the 100mm X 100mm limit.
- 2 this is sized similar to original. 

PCB
- Done edit but
- Not tested
