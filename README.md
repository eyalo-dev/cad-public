This is my public CAD/PCB file.
Mostly from old magazines and some of my own.
These are not an exact copy but functionaly similar to the original magazine artical.
I also try to make the PCBs smaller than 100mm by 100mm, when posible, as this seem to be 
the entry level pricing in most PCB fabrication places.

Note that all files created using Kicad 5.0.
